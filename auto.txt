So, you know the basics of individual
instructions and that a program is just a
series of instructions. But programming
real strength isnt just running one instruction
after another like a weekend errand list. Based on
how expressions evaluate, a program can decide
to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions
to run. In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the
first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. Flow
control statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under
which conditions.
These flow control statements directly correspond to the symbols in
a flowchart, so Ill provide flowchart versions of the code discussed in this
chapter. Figure 2-1 shows a flowchart for what to do if its raining. Follow
the path made by the arrows from Start to End.
